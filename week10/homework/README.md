## Question 3.1 ##

- The nascent RNA signal, determined based on incorporation of EU-Alexa488 labeled uracil, provides information on whether or not the cell is undergoing active trasncription. In other words, this provides insight into whether the cell is in the G1 stage of the cell cycle, when cells are most actively transcribing genes to perform functions.

- The PCNA signal, determined based on signal from an anti-PCNA antibody, provides information on whether or not the cell is undergoing DNA replication, which can tell us whether the cell is in active S phase (when DNA replication occurs).

- The log2 ratio between nascent RNA signal and PCNA signal provides a metric to assess how robust transcription is in the cell relative to DNA replication, which when taken together across a sample, provides insight into the tendency of cells to be in G1 or S phase (perhaps this can even inform us of cell cycle stalling or difficulty passing a checkpoint).

- Gene name tells us which gene is being knocked down by siRNA. All examinations of signal from each nucleus in each sample, then, allow us to investigate whether certain genes are necessary/required for progression through certain cell cycle stages.


## Question 3.2 ##

- SRSF1 has the highest ratio of nascent RNA signal to PCNA signal. Given that SRSF1 is a splicing factor, the high ratio makes sense in the SRSF1 knock-down, since the RNAs that are being transcribed can't be as efficiently spliced, which leads to their accumulation in the nucleus and an increase in nascent RNA signal.

- APEX1 has the lowest ratio of nascent RNA signal to PCNA signal. APEX1 is an endonuclease that contributes to a DNA repair mechanism during DNA replication. The low ratio, then, makes sense, because knock-down of APEX1 would negatively impact DNA repair pathways, which may stall the cell in S phase to prevent propagation of damaged and mismatched DNA (stalled S phase would generate a greater PCNA signal relative to the nascent RNA signal).
